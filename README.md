# axios-cancel-previous-req-demo

### Motivation

While watching @tylermcginnis33 react fundementals(updated) free course on react-training i tried to implement a 
functionality which is cancel the previous request if user try to send a new request before previous request resolved. 
But I couldn't find a working example in axios library to cancel previous request. So i create a small demo application in JavaScript to illustrate how to cancel previous request with axios library
