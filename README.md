# axios-cancel-previous-req-demo

#### Motivation ðŸ’ª

While watching [@tylermcginnis33](https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis) - [react fundementals](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/) free course on react-training i tried to implement a 
functionality which is cancel the previous request if user try to send a new request before previous request resolved. 
But I couldn't find a working example in axios library to cancel previous request. So i create a small demo application in JavaScript to illustrate how to cancel previous request with axios library

#### How to start
* Clone the project
* Open ```index.html``` file in the browser

#### Check whether previous request get cancelled or not
* Open network tab in the developer tools.
* Switch language tab quickly. (Demo purpose request will be resolved 500ms later)

#### Note
Initially I created this demo application as a gist over a year ago.
